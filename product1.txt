We love Moody's butcher shop so much. With prices in stores these days, you get a better quality meat from a trusted source. The steaks are thicker, you can find cuts like tri-tip here and the salmon is so fresh from here. Every time we walk in the staff knows who we are and knows our kids. Absolutely one of the best places to go.
